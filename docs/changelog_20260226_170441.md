# clarc — Update Help Page for Multi-Source Support

**Date**: 2026-02-26

## Overview

Updated the built-in Help & Guide page to reflect multi-source directory support. References to a single `~/.claude/` source directory were updated to describe multiple configurable source directories with unified merging.

## Changes

### Updated: Help page multi-source references

- Welcome section: mentions multiple source directories and unified merging
- Projects section: references synced `projects/` directory instead of hardcoded `~/.claude/projects/`
- Settings section: describes multi-source editor with add/remove and WSL auto-detect
- Data safety section: uses "source directories" instead of hardcoded `~/.claude/`
- Data sync section: explains flat-merging from all configured sources
