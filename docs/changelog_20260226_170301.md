# clarc — Gitignore docker-compose.override.yml for Personal Config

**Date**: 2026-02-26

## Overview

Added `docker-compose.override.yml` to `.gitignore` so developers can add personal volume mounts and environment variable overrides (e.g., multi-source directories on WSL) without modifying the committed `docker-compose.yml`. Docker Compose automatically merges both files.

## Changes

### Added: docker-compose.override.yml to .gitignore

Developers can now create a `docker-compose.override.yml` for personal configuration. Common use case: mounting a Windows-side `.claude` directory on WSL and setting a colon-separated `CLARC_CLAUDE_DIR` for multi-source sync.

### Updated: DEV_GUIDE.md

- Added "Personal overrides" section under Container Architecture with example `docker-compose.override.yml` for multi-source WSL setup
- Added `docker-compose.override.yml` to the project file tree listing
